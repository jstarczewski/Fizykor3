# General Info
I decided to split Fizykor into two seprate repositories. Fizykor3 is a small playground for me to test out new technologies and solutions. The production version is available [here](https://github.com/jstarczewski/Fizykor4). The difference is that production version is simplified to maximazie the performence of Fizykor (app is quite heavy becasue of multiple WebViews).
